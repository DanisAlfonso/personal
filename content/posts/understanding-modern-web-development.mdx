# Understanding Modern Web Development

Modern web development has evolved significantly over the past decade. With the rise of frameworks like React, Next.js, and tools like TypeScript, developers now have more power and flexibility than ever before.

## The Rise of React and Component-Based Architecture

React introduced a revolutionary way of building user interfaces through components. This approach has several benefits:

- **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different parts of your application
- **Maintainability**: Each component is isolated and easier to test
- **Performance**: React's virtual DOM ensures efficient updates

```jsx
function Button({ children, onClick }) {
  return (
    <button 
      className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## The Impact of TypeScript

TypeScript has transformed how we write JavaScript applications. It brings:

1. Type safety
2. Better IDE support
3. Improved maintainability
4. Fewer runtime errors

## Looking to the Future

The web development landscape continues to evolve. Some exciting trends include:

- Server Components
- Edge Computing
- AI-powered development tools
- WebAssembly
