## About Me

I was born in Honduras in 1989. From 2014 to 2019, I taught physics at various institutions in my home country, primarily at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras (UNAH). My journey into programming began with C++ during my physics studies, followed by Python for teaching and personal projects. Currently based in Spain, I'm focused on building modern web applications and exploring various programming languages and technologies.
