                    <p>
                      I was born in 1989, in a rather remote place‚Äîa rural area in Honduras, Central America, with likely fewer than a hundred inhabitants. Between the ages of fifteen and seventeen, I received technical training as an electrician. In another life, or perhaps in some parallel universe, I might have devoted my days to the study of music. But by then, pursuing music formally at a university level was far beyond my reach‚Äîoutside the realm of my skills, my realistic options, or even my imagination.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      Among the paths that did feel possible‚Äîand that held my interest‚Äîwere mathematics, physics, philosophy, history, and the fields of electrical or computer engineering. I chose physics. For about five years, I worked as a physics instructor, teaching introductory courses to engineering students, before eventually leaving that job behind.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      There was always something deeply fascinating to me about expressing ideas in a way that a machine could understand and follow. Admittedly, I struggled with it‚Äîbut that was more than a decade ago, and much has changed since then. I used to write programs line by line, solving linear equations or implementing numerical methods for differential equations in C++. It was a slow, painstaking process‚Äîfrustratingly tedious and, at times, far beyond my comfort zone.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      Today, things are different. The emergence of technologies like large language models has transformed that landscape. What once seemed like a distant dream‚Äîthe ability to articulate complex ideas in natural human language and have machines understand‚Äîhas become a reality. And it&apos;s a remarkable one. Being able to communicate in plain language, without having to master Python, TypeScript, C++, or any other programming language, feels like a genuine breakthrough. Of course, as with any major shift, some embrace it, while others resist.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      Circumstances‚Äîthose ever-unpredictable forces‚Äîhave not allowed me to dedicate myself fully to creative pursuits like music, physics, or programming. Life&apos;s demands have taken me down other roads. But whenever time allows, I return to them. They remain, even now, my quiet sources of joy.
